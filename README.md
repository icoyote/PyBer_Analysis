# Pyber Analysis #

## Overview of the analysis: ##

For this project we explored the different types of charts that we can generate based on RideSharing data iand how it can provide very quick overviews of larger amount of data.

For the riding share data 2 files in CSV format were read and later merged into 1 dataframe.
